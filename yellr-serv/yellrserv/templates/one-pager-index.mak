          <p class="about-p">
            WXXI Public Radio has partnered with HackHackers Rochester to develop Yellr, a new Citizen Journalism mobile app designed to widen audience engagement, especially among younger, technologically-driven and under-represented community members.

          <p class="about-p">
            The platform – in English and Spanish - enables broad participation from community members in sharing and posting news and other community related information and events.  The project was seeded by a grant funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, administered by the Institute for Nonprofit News.

              <p>
              The app enables people to upload free contributions or respond to assignments from news and community moderators. While people can still contribute anonymously, each post has a unique identifier that enables moderators to communicate with and verify information if required. Users are also encouraged to create their own user profile and establish a following in their area of interest. A geo-fencing feature enables assignments and stories to be tailored specifically to different communities and regions.
All contributions are captured here in this moderation dashboard. The difference between existing social media and the Yellr platform is this editorial firewall between the contributor and the audience. Nothing goes out until it’s assessed at this stage. Once stories have been moderated and edited, they can be posted to the Yellr storefront as well as published on other websites.

              A group of educational and media partners are working together to promote the technology and encourage participation and exchange. Student groups at RIT are working to rollout uptake of the app amongst a number of Rochester committees including LGBT students and church-based youth groups in the city’s 19th Ward. The goal is to empower those traditionally under-represented communities with a platform that can enable them to share their perspectives and respond to a variety of community news assignments. Ultimately that content will also be used to enhance and expand the range of voices distributed through public media outlets, like WXXI News.

              WXXI is committed to finding new ways to reach wider audiences including the younger, technologically-driven generation as well as the under-represented population of the local community in upstate New York. The app offers new and enhanced ways for these communities to engage in local and, possibly in the future, national society. It is designed to be an “open source platform” that can be shared with other public television and radio stations in upstate New York and other regions in the future.
